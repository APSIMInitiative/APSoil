      <h1>APSOIL 6.12 release notes</h1>
      <p>22nd February 2011</p>

      <p>This is a minor release of APSOIL fixing the following issues.
          <ul>
            <li>A minor fix to the importing of .soils files from XLS files. Thickness was being corrupted.</li>
            <li>A minor fix to the upgrading of .soils files from previous versions.</li>
            <li>The export of soils to a spreadsheet now works correctly. Previously, not all data was being exported.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      
      <h1>APSOIL 6.0 release notes</h1>
      <p>20th August 2010</p>

      <p>This release of APSOIL is a major revision with many defects fixed and some new functionality added. It
         is compatible with APSIM 7.2.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to the way soil nodes are visualised</h2>
      <p>One major change incorporated into APSIM 7.2 concerns the way the user interface displays soil information</p>
      
      <p>In previous versions of APSIM, a soil was represented as a single soil node with a series of grid sheets for general, 
         water, profile and other soil data. For example:</p>
         <img src="OldSoilNode.gif"/>
      
      <p>This has now changed to multiple nodes for different types of soil information</p>
         <img src="NewSoilNode.gif">
         
         
      <p>This has several major advantages for APSIM over the old structure.
         <ul>
            <li>Each node in the tree can now have a different layer structure. 
                For example, the water node (with BD, LL15 etc) can be on the normal 
                deep layer structure, while the lab node (with NO3, NH4, Water) can be 
                on a 0-10, 10-60. The user interface will map the different layer structures 
               into a single consolidated one that APSIM can handle.</li>
            <li>Different nodes can be added in as needed. For example, the user might 
                add a "Phosphorus" node when needed. This saves always having to have it 
                there just in case a user may want it at some time. Likewise the "SoilWat" 
                node (which has SWCON, MWCON, CN2 etc) can be removed and replaced with a 
                SWIM node that contains SWIM parameters. This will allow all the soils 
                in the characterisation database to be used with the SWIM model - 
               something that wasn't possible in earlier versions of APSIM.</li>
         </ul></p>
      <h2>Changes to the APSOIL spreadsheet format</h2>
      <p>To support the changes to the above visualisation of nodes and to support extra soil information, 
      the spreadsheet format has changed.</p>
         <img src="NewSpreadsheetFormat.gif"/>
      <p>The best way to see these changes is to contact Neal Dalgliesh for a sample spreadsheet. NB The old 
      format will not work with this version of APSoil</p>
